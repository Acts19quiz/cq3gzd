 ZDoom LE (Legacy Edition), a fork of the ZDoom 2.8.1 maintenance branch (https://github.com/rheit/zdoom/tree/maint)
for Windows 9x and old machines. It's compiled with pentium ii optimizations and low detail modes have been restored.
 Created at vogons (http://www.vogons.org) by blue-green-frog and continued by drfrag.
 Compiles with MinGW using Allegro DX9 libraries (Xinput support has been removed) and a modified OpenAL-soft.
 Can compile as well with allegro DX8 libraries but without Direct3D support.

 Compiles with CMake 2.8.12, CodeBlocks 16.01 (TDM-GCC 4.9.2) and NASM 2.10.09. You'll need the following libraries:
dx9mgw.zip, dx80_mgw.zip (optional), openal-soft-1.12.854, mpg123-1.20-1-x86.zip, libsndfile-1.0.25-w32.setup.exe,
fluidsynth.7z (optional) and fmodapi43623win-installer.exe (optional).
 To get win95 support you need TDM-GCC 4.6.1 instead, anyway it's better to install TDM-GCC 4.6.1 since it's faster
than 4.9.2.
 
 Some notes:
 - Fluidsynth doesn't work with OpenAL.
 - Compiling with FMOD Ex support works but the exe would require Windows 98 to run.
 - The diff patch to OpenAL-soft can be applied on windows with gnu32 patch from an admin cmd prompt.
 - You can link directly against the dlls but not for DX (dinput).
 - Run CMake to generate a CodeBlocks makefile and fill or change the paths to executables and libraries.
